## Scrum Workflow
1. **Sprint Planning**: The team discusses the scope of each sprint, selecting tasks from the product backlog based on priority and capacity.
2. **Daily Stand-ups**: A 15-minute daily meeting to sync up on progress, blockers, and planned work.
3. **Sprint Review**: Held at the end of each sprint to demonstrate completed work and gather feedback.
4. **Sprint Retrospective**: The team reviews what went well, what could be improved, and actionable steps for the next sprint.

## Sprint Documentation
Each sprint has a separate document detailing its:
- **Goal**: Specific focus or objective.
- **Backlog**: List of tasks with priorities.
- **Review**: Summary of the completed work and any changes.
- **Retrospective**: Observations and adjustments to improve future sprints.

## Tools and Boards
We use **[Trello]** for tracking progress, managing backlogs, and updating sprint tasks.
